I am pursuing my Ph.D. from
Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India
in Electrical Engineering department.

My research focus is on sparse representations
and compressed sensing.

Publications

None yet.


Notes
------------------

During the course of study, I have
prepared some notes which have helped
me understand the field better. These
notes are purely draft and for personal
use. They are not published in any
scientific literature. They are being
shared here with the belief that they
might be of some use to other
budding researchers.

All errors and omissions are purely mine.

In case you have any feedback or any
concern regarding these notes, please
write to me [shailesh (at) indigits (dot) com].


Illustrated Compressed Sensing
-----------------------------------------


This is a slightly large set of notes covering the
principles of sparse representations and
compressed sensing. The notes are quite
mathematics oriented and they cover
the derivations of a good variety of
results in the field from a number of
sources.

References
-------------------------

This is a small bibliography of references
I have prepared during the course of my study.
While this is much smaller than the
list of references at 
[Rice Compressive Sensing Resources](http://dsp.rice.edu/cs), there are some specific
features in this document which you might
find useful. It attempts to give a chronological
list of papers around which specific concepts
like spark, coherence, different recovery 
algorithms grew over time. There is a detailed
table of contents listing specific concepts
and then a list of papers for each concept.
See for yourself.
