The beginning of open source journey
============================================

I have been using open source software for last 15 years I would imagine.
Yet my own contribution to the world of open source is probably next to
zero. 

May be it is now time to pull up the socks and start doing things. 
This blog is being setup on Github pages on October 17, 2014 
to start this journey. I have no idea how far will I be able to
go ahead. I usually have this habit of starting projects and
leaving them in the middle.
