I, Shailesh Kumar, am a part-time researcher, part-time developer, 
part-time manager and part-time procrastinator. 


I have around 20 years of experience in software design, 
development, support, and management. 
My areas of interest include digital media technologies, 
machine learning, computer vision, cloud computing, and SaaS. 


I usually spend half of my day answering all the emails, 
Skype or phone calls, chats, helping people resolve knotty issues, 
making slides, fixing Excel sheets, or filling up some or other paperwork. 

The other half is spent learning something new or building something useful. 
I still dream that I will be able to build and 
leave behind something worthwhile before I go. 

In my leisure, I dabble a bit in 
learning about business, finance, history, philosophy and music.

## Education

I graduated in 2002 from the 
department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering,
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.

Currently, I am pursuing my part-time Ph.D. 
from Bharti School of Telecommunications,
Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India.


## Work Experience


I joined [Interra Systems ](https://interrasystems.com/) 
right after graduation.
At Interra, I have been involved with the development of
the flagship products [Vega ](https://interrasystems.com/analyzers.php), 
[Baton ](https://interrasystems.com/file-based-qc.php),
[Orion ](https://interrasystems.com/content-monitoring.php),
and 
[Winnow ](https://interrasystems.com/content-classification.php).
I am also driving [Interra Cloud Services ](https://interra.cloud/#/home)
SaaS platform. 

Currently, I am working as a Director of Engineering at Interra Systems.

## Programming


I have done coding in a variety of languages: Intel assembly, TI DSP, C, C++, 
Java, C#, Lisp, Haskell, Rust, Go, MATLAB, R, PHP, Perl, Verilog, etc.

My current workhorses are Python and JavaScript. 

It took me a while to get out of the dogma of OOPS. 
Functional programming probably had the deepest impact on 
my software design thinking. Haskell is mind-blowing.
However, day to day programming works well with 
multi-paradigm languages. 
I believe that C++ and Python are 
decent practical solutions. 

What really matters is to choose the right tool for a job based 
on skill, experience, and fitness for the job. 
For web development, I like Vue and NodeJS these days 
and for Deep Learning: TensorFlow and related libraries. 

I prefer the Kanban framework for agile software development. 


## A Salute


What I have learned so far is all thanks to the written works 
of great scientists and engineers around the world 
(their books, articles, code). 

I would not have been where I am without all the 
great open-source software available to everyone. 
I try to contribute and give back as much as I can.
